# Quick-Start-Course-Dir  

A little program for me to quickly open the directory for my course folder, without clicking through lots of directory or symlink in file explorer.  
Because I am Lazy.

Configure the program via config.json on the same directory of the program, template is provided [here](./configTemplate.json)

`dirPath`: Absolute path to the root directory of all the folders to search  
`inputName.<key>.alias` alias for the `key`'s function as the input argument for the program  
<sub> Further custumization is not provided, as this is not the usage of the program for me. </sub>

```
<program.exe> <stringInput OR Alias>
```
`<stringInput>`: name of the folder path relative to the dirPath in config.json.  
> Input of `COMP2012` or `COMP 2012` translates to `<dirPath>/COMP/2012` or selected in CLI by fuzzy string matching.
